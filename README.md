# Heroes 3 + Machine Learning
## Reinforcement Learning for heroes battles
#### Project contains environment for human and AI play. 
#### Now I am working on environment.

#### I suspect that I have not rights to upload original images for animations. But you can get these images in .lod files of original game
### Programs:
#### DefPreview - to read .lod files that contains info about different objects like units, magic, resources, buildings and other objects on map
#### MMArchive - to extract images from objects
#### Instruction: to extract objects using DefPreview and then to extract image from object using MMArchive

#### -----
#### Feel free to contact with me, if you have questions, suggestions or ideas related to this project, machine learning or game development
